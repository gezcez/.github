# Gezcez.com GitHub page
home-made and open source public transit services that can be used across various cities in Türkiye.

## GOAL
[Gezcez.com](https://gezcez.com/?referrer=github.com)'s main goal is to give the people an open source and free-of-charge alternative to currently available public transit apps on the market.
We really want to let people commute in a more predictable way.
All of our source codes (yes, including backend!) are publicly available,
HOWEVER we still need to keep some stuff private like the services we pull user data from, which may or may not include [ transit card nos, transit card discount types, transit card transactions_], for more detailed information on the data that passes through our servers please see [data providers](https://gezcez.com/privacy/data-providers?referrer=github.com) page.

## for those concerned about their privacy
**WE DO NOT AND WILL NOT COLLECT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM DATA PROVIDERS AND ONLY STORE DISCOUNT TYPES, CARD NOS OR SIMILAR BASIC INFORMATION FOR CACHING PURPOSES.**
For detailed information or to hide your data please see our [privacy guide](https://gezcez.com/privacy/hide-my-data?referrer=github.com)


## extras
as of 07/11/2025 this project is "planned for future" and will continue being worked on depending on the response from driventure.vc
(i dont wanna crash someone else's prod for a 1 MAU idea)
